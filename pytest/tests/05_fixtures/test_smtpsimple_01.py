# Test functions can receive fixture objects by naming them as an input argument. 
# For each argument name, a fixture function with that name provides the fixture object.
# Fixture functions are registered by marking them with @pytest.fixture. Letâ€™s look at
# a simple self-contained test module containing a fixture and a test function using it
