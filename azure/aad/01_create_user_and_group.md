# 01 - Add and delete users using Azure Active Directory
Add new users or delete existing users from your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization. To add or delete users you must be a User administrator or Global administrator.

# Task 1: Add a new user
You can create a new user using the Azure Active Directory portal.
To add a new user, follow these steps:
1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** in the User Administrator role for the organization.

2. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory** from any page.

3. Select **Users**, and then select **New user**.

4. On the User page, enter information for this user,
4.1 **Name**. Required. The first and last name of the new user. For example, Mary Parker.
4.2 **User name**. Required. The user name of the new user. 
4.3 Copy the autogenerated password provided in the Password box. You'll need to give this password to the user to sign in for the first time.
4.4 **Groups**. Optionally, you can add the user to one or more existing groups. You can also add the user to groups at a later time.
4.5 **Job info**: You can add more information about the user here, or do it later.

5. Select **Create**.

The user is created and added to your Azure AD organization.
