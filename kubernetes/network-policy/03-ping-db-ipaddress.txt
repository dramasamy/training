1. get the Pod IP and ping the address
    [dinesh@master1 ~]$ kubectl get pods -o wide -n net-policy
    NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE                NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
    db-deployment-9b75668-klhn7           1/1     Running   0          26m    10.244.71.211   worker3   <none>           <none>
    frontend-deployment-95c497f7b-fvkp5   1/1     Running   0          3m6s   10.244.71.212   worker3   <none>           <none>
    web-deployment-7694466dd-gj8hw        1/1     Running   0          26m    10.244.71.210   worker3   <none>           <none>

2. Ping 10.244.71.211 from master, worker and frontend - It works as the Pod can communicate with each other in kubernetes
