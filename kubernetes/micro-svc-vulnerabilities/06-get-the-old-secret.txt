# Get the 'my-secret' again, it won't be encrypted
ETCDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt get /registry/secrets/default/my-secret

API server is able to reacd the old secret because it has and indentifier without encryption; while reading API server uses all the available identitiy providers so it is able to raed. identity: {}; but while creating the secret it would go by the config order. So any new secret will be encrypted
