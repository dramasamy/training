# Policy Order
# -----------
# In addition to restricting pod creation and update, pod security policies can also be
# used to provide default values for many of the fields that it controls. When multiple
# policies are available, the pod security policy controller selects policies according 
# to the following criteria:
#
# 1. PodSecurityPolicies which allow the pod as-is, without changing defaults or mutating
#    the pod, are preferred. The order of these non-mutating PodSecurityPolicies doesn't 
#    matter.
# 2. If the pod must be defaulted or mutated, the first PodSecurityPolicy (ordered by name)
#    to allow the pod is selected.
